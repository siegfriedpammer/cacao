CACAO specific installation instructions
========================================

* CLASSPATH, classfiles & other Java weirdness
----------------------------------------------

Make sure you have classfiles which work with cacao. A version of
these can be found at
ftp://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/pub/java/cacao/classes.zip.gz

After the installation of these set the environment variable CLASSPATH
to the directories where your class libraries are stored. E. g. if you
unzipped classes.zip in the directory /usr/local/lib/java/classes set
the CLASSPATH environment variable to /usr/local/lib/java/classes.

* configuring & compiling CACAO
-------------------------------

  1. Unpack the tar archive (apparently you have done this, otherwise
     you wouldn't read this file.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type make.

After this you should have a working version of cacao and cacaoh. How to
invoke cacao and which class library has to be used is described at the
CACAO home page (http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/java/cacao/index.html).
