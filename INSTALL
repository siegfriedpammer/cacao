Quick start instructions
========================

You can check the configure options via `./configure --help'. But the
default settings should be ok. For building the package type:

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make install

The default installation prefix is `/usr/local/cacao'. You can change
this destination by providing the `--prefix=PATH' option to configure.

This version of cacao only supports the `--prefix' option, even if
configure processes the other options (`--bindir', `--libdir', etc.),
it will screw up your installation since CACAO tries to setup a
directory tree like the JVMs from Sun or IBM do.


Requirements:
-------------

In order to compile the Java classes from GNU classpath, you need a
Java compiler supported by GNU classpath. To get a working classpath
in an appropriate time, we recommend IBM jikes 1.18 or newer. For
further instructions concerning GNU classpath, please refer to
`src/classpath/INSTALL'.
