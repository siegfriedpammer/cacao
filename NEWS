New in relaese 0.90 (December 8, 2004)

  * Native thread support
  * Java 1.4 support
  * GNU classpath 0.12
  * Preliminary AWT support
  * Boehm garbage collector
  * Reentrant JIT compiler
  * Lots of bug fixes and conformance enhancements
  * Lots of bugs introduced and not fixed


* Version 0.40 (released)
=========================

** Boehm garbage collector supported
------------------------------------

The --enable-gc2 options was replaced by --with-gc. Choose boehm for the
Boehm garbage collector. Also see README.boehm.

** mips port
------------

Now runs on some SGI systems, which are based on the mips architecture.

** multiple bug fixes
---------------------

Even more java programs work as expected!


* Version 0.35 (experimental)
=============================

** autoconf, automake support
-----------------------------

Finally moved the entire distribution to autoconf/automake. This should fix
some of our problems with supporting different compilers. Thread support and
the use of the new garbage collector can be enabled/disabled from using
configure arguments:

	--enable-threads [default]
	--disable-threads

	--enable-gc2 [default]
	--disable-gc2

** new garbage collector
------------------------

Included the new garbage collector as default garbage collector. 

* Version 0.30 (released)
=========================

Added unlimited stack for GC and main thread. 
Some optimzations for instructions which operate on constants. 

* Version 0.20 (released)
=========================

Hardware null pointer check added, fixed severe errors in GC/Threads, type
check and IEEE arithmetic.

* Version 0.20beta (can't remember)
=========================

There is a completely new JIT compiler which is about 7 times faster and
produces better code. 
Multithreading is now supported. 
A lot of bugs have been fixed.

* Version 0.10 (ancient history)
==============

The initial version included the old JIT and support for lang, util and io.
