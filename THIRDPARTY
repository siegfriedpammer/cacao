Several files supporting GNU-style builds are copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, and carry a different license from that given
below.

A few of the files needed to use the GNU-style build procedure come with
slightly different licenses, though they are all similar in spirit.  A few
are GPL'ed, but with an exception that should cover all uses in the
collector.  (If you are concerned about such things, I recommend you look
at the notice in config.guess or ltmain.sh.)
