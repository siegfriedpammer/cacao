STACK FRAME FORMAT
=====================
Author: Edwin Steiner


Overview
--------

For the sake of efficiency CACAO uses its own stack frame layout that does
not comply with the usual frame layout on the native ABI. This document
tries to collect the stack frame layouts used on the various architectures.


i386 stack frames
-----------------

>>>> sp in method (after initial sub) <<<<

u4[]  arguments for calling methods
u4[]  local variable slots allocated on stack
u4[]  callee-saved registers

>>>> sp on method entry <<<<

u4[]  arguments on stack
