 * "don't reschedule if you don't have to". Now it is "don't do ANY
 * rescheduling actions due to an expired timer". An alternative would be to
 * block SIGALARM during critical sections (by means of sigprocmask). But
 * this would be required quite often (for every outmost intsDisable(),
 * intsRestore()) and therefore would be much more expensive than just
 * setting an int flag which - sometimes - might cause an additional
 * setitimer call.
